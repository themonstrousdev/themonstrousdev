## Introduction
Hello, everyone. You can refer to me by the name Elle and I'm a Computer Science student on my third year. Most of what you will see on this profile that are public are my old projects from back when I was freelancing. It's not much and I like to believe I've improved a lot since then. There may be a stray school project that will pop up every so often but for now, there's not much to see.

I have so much to learn but I hope to only grow from here!
